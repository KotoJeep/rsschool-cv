## About me

I don't have any real development experience, but I like to learn and learn new things. I like to find solutions to difficult problems and watch my code "come to life" in the browser

## Hard skills

- HTML
- CSS
- preprocessor SASS
- Bootstrap library
- BEM
- Javascript (entry level)

## Code examples

```
function closeModal() {
modal.classList.add('hide');
modal.classList.remove('show');
document.body.style.overflow = '';
}
function openModal() {
modal.classList.add('show');
modal.classList.remove('hide');
document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden';
clearInterval(modalTimerId);
}
modal.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
if (e.target === modal || e.target.getAttribute('data-close') == "") {
closeModal();
}
});
```

## Work experience

I have studied several online courses on html and css. As part of the training, I created several landing pages, some of them can be found in my github profile, the rest will be added later to my portfolio site.
